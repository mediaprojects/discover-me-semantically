<h2>SerenA Study</h2>

The purpose of our study is to explore and evaluate a semantic
approach that supports academic researchers by providing computerized
recommendations that are diverse and novel. This study is part of <a style="font-size: 11pt;" target="_blank" href="http://www.serena.ac.uk">SerenA: Chance Encounters</a> in the Space of Ideas.


<br><br>
<B>What we’ll ask you to do:</B>
<br>
<li> We'll ask you to complete an electronic form about your research
  interests. You can do this using the Firefox or Chrome web browsers (we’re
  sorry but it doesn’t work with Microsoft's Internet Explorer!)

<li> Over the next few days our software will create some recommendations
  about papers you might be interested in reading and other
  researchers whose work you might like to know about

<li> We'll arrange an interview where we'll show you the information
  we’ve prepared and ask you for some feedback.
<br><br>
The names of people who complete the electronic form and the interview
will go into a hat to win a £25 Amazon voucher.
<br><br>
<B>How we'll use the information:</B>
<br>
The information you give us will help us to evaluate our approach to
providing interesting and valuable suggestions to academic
researchers. We may publish the results of our evaluation. We will
store information from the electronic questionnaires, and take notes
and complete questionnaires during the interview. Data from the
interview and electronic questionnaire will be stored anonymously. We
will only publish anonymous quotes from the interviews. We ask for
your names and email addresses so that we can contact you for the
interview and in case you win the vouchers.
<br><br>
You can decide not to take part in the study at any time. You will
join the study when you press the “Sign Up” button on the electronic
form. After that, if you decide not to take part after all, please
email [d dot s dot bental at hw dot ac dot uk] and we’ll remove your information.
<br><br>
<i>If you need to contact us:</i> Diana Bental [ at hw dot ac dot uk] or Rob Stewart [rs46 at hw dot ac dot uk]
